## IN-16 NIXIE tube clock

## Summary

A Nixie tube, or cold cathode display, is an electronic device for displaying numerals or other information using glow discharge.
Although it resembles a vacuum tube in appearance, its operation does not depend on thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode. 
It is therefore called a cold-cathode tube (a form of gas-filled tube), or a variant of neon lamp. 
Such tubes rarely exceed 40 Â°C even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature.

Altough you should be careful attempting to build this project because these tubes run on a high voltage (170V). Do not play around with high voltage unless you know exactly what you're doing!
